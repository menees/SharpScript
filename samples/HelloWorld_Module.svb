'A VB.NET "Hello, World" sample using a VB Module.

'Other assemblies can be referenced by using SharpScript's "reference"
'directive as shown below.  This example shows how to reference the
'"System.Design.dll".  This script doesn't make use of anything in that
'assembly, but it demonstrates how to refer to another assembly when
'necessary.
'#reference "System.Design.dll"

Module Hello

    Sub Main()
        Script.Echo("Hello, World, from VB.NET.")
    End Sub
